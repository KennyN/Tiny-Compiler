This is a simple compiler program that performs lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation for a specified programming language. The compiler takes an input source file, performs the necessary analysis and generation steps, and produces a machine code output file.
Features

Usage

    Ensure you have the necessary environment to compile and run the program (e.g., C compiler such as gcc).
    Open the command line or terminal.
    Navigate to the directory where the program source code is located.
    Compile the source code using the appropriate compiler command. For example:

    "gcc parsercodegen.c"

Run the compiled program, specifying the input source file as a command-line argument. For example:

    "./parsercodegen input.txt"

    Replace input.txt with the actual filename of your input source code file.
    
    The program will perform lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation for the input source code.
    Check the terminal output for any compilation errors or warnings. The program will display messages indicating the success of the compilation process or any encountered issues.
    
    If the compilation is successful, the program will generate a machine code output file. The filename and format will be specified in the assignment instructions.
